## Introduction
<p>
Hello! My name is Mitchell and I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a concentration in software engineering. I have close to 3 years of software engineering experience and have gained essential and applicable computer science knowledge that I can utilize throughout the entire software development lifecycle. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
While completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have been able to directly apply the concepts and skills I have learned every day in my       current role. Additionally, I have been able to learn new technologies and tools which has allowed me to learn how to pick up new skills quickly and effectively. Throughout the CS program at SNHU, I have studied and learned <strong>Agile methodologies</strong> and <strong>team collaboration</strong> with the use of <strong>Git and Bitbucket</strong> to work together with peers in the CS program while completing code reviews and learning from constructive feedback. Within my Software Development Lifecycle course, I have also learned how to <strong>communicate to stakeholders</strong> and have experience interacting with customers to gather requiements and implmement requested features. Additionally, I have studied <strong>data structures and algorithms</strong> at SNHU and have had opportunities to implement algorithms for products in my current role. Other important skills I have gained throughout my time in the CS program are software engineering and databases and have practiced security by learning secure coding best practices. The following artifacts are projects that I have completed either for coursework or outside of coursework for my Capstone project, giving me the opportunity to learn new technologies, improve on, and showcase my strengths. These artifacts fit together to form how well-rounded my skills are and showcase that I am prepared to tackle and excel in all challenges I will face in taking the next steps in my career.

## Code Review
<p>
The following link will take you to a code review video that will walk through and describe the artifacts I will be showcasing and the enhancements I plan to make. I will also be analyzing the code structure of the projects how they existed before improving them and looking for ways that I can optimize the code.

## Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering
<p>
The first artifact that I am choosing to enhance and submit for my portfolio is a project that I started in CS 350 Mobile Architecture and Programming. I began working on this during the 2020 term from September to October. This project is a study helper app that basically lets the user add their own subjects and questions to a database and create answers. It is a flash card replacement type of app. 
<br>
I decided to include this artifact into my portfolio because I feel like it showcases a lot of different elements of software design and engineering. There were periods of design and planning needed prior to writing code and this artifact also makes use of SQLite which helped improve my skills in database management. The artifact was improved by adding these additional ways to add, remove, and update customized questions and subjects for the app, where as before, it was more basic and only let someone add new questions. I also included a nicer looking layout for the app and implemented a dark theme for users to select via a new settings activity within the app.
<br>
Working through this artifact had its challenges. I spent a lot of time looking at online resources and through Googleâ€™s documentation for Android development. I learned a lot about how to effectively read and use documentation to help with my own personalized implementation of things. In addition to that, I gained an improved understanding of the Android SDK and architecture.

## Artifact 2: Algorithm and Data Structures
<p>
The second artifact that I chose to enhance and submit for my portfolio is a side project I worked on near the beginning of my programming learning, around October of 2018. This project is written in Java and serves to help me understand that binary search tree algorithm by writing my own node class and binary search algorithm. Then I enhanced it by creating a GUI to attempt to display how the values are stored in the tree and then they are displayed in order as the algorithm runs. 
<br>
I chose to include this artifact into my portfolio because I feel it showcases knowledge of ArrayLists and how the binary sorting algorithm works, any my ability to work with these data structures and algorithm to manipulate data when needed to. The artifact was improved by creating a Java Swing frame to create a visual representation of how the algorithm runs. This also helped improve my knowledge of Swing layouts, specifically GroupLayout and when to work with a null layout to specifically place components wherever needed. 
<br>
From enhancing this artifact, I became more familiar with Swing and GUI creation as a result and forced me to think about UI design as well. I had a hard time getting everything to look correct on the frame and found myself missing components while testing, so I had to figure out what some common pitfalls are to Swing programming, which was helpful in improving my debugging skills as well. Overall, I feel more comfortable with Java Swing and the data structures and algorithm used for this artifact.

## Artifact 3: Databases
<p>
The third artifact that I am choosing to submit for my portfolio is a Java CRUD API App using MongoDB with the use of Spring Boot. The app will be a simple REST API app to implement CRUD functionality for an Indoor Drumline group, which is one way I enjoy volunteering my time as an instructor. This will be used create new users like students and staff and assign each a role within the group. This idea is that this could be used as a steppingstone to have a full-fledged database and web application to keep track of things like competitions, travel itinerary, etc. This artifact was created earlier this month due to wanting to learn how to utilize MongoDB with Java Spring Framework and implement an OAuth authentication with Okta. 
<br>
I believe that this artifact will demonstrate a few key components, one of them being my curiosity and interest in growth for different technologies. The software engineering field is constantly changing, so constantly learn new things and pick up new technologies will be a useful skill for my career. The other skills showcased will include being able to use Okta and Spring Security to set up JWT authentication for this application. I was also able to learn the fundamentals of testing REST APIs by utilizing HTTPie which is a simple command-line tool for making HTTP requests. 
<br>
I learned a lot from setting up a Spring project and configuring Gradle dependencies to use Spring and Okta. Being able to create this project within a CentOS virtual machine improved my development and configuration experience due to how powerful the CLI is to create the right development environment. In addition to that, learning a new API and framework such as Spring always poses new challenges and learning curves to try to understand the best practices and ensuring efficient use of them as a result. Luckily, the developer support and documentation for it is vast and proved invaluable when setting up this project. Additionally, setting up an OAuth 2.0 authorization in this project was beneficial to implementing security best practices by making authenticated and authorized requests to the database.
